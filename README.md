# Smartsheet API 101

I haven't seen a lot of bite-sized examples (or examples of any size) for interacting with the Smartsheet API. There are surely many people who need to pull data off Smartsheet, but are either not experienced programmers, or don't have the time to futz around with it.

While I'm not quite the former, I have a bit of the latter.

This is intended as a one stop shop, growing repository of simple examples of how to I/O your Smartsheet assets, manipulate the data therein, and push it to other services.
